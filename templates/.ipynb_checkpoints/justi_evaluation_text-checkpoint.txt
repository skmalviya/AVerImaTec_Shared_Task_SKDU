You will get as input a reference justification ([REF]) and a predicted justification ([PRED]).
Please verify the correctness of the predicted justifications by comparing it to the reference justifcations, following these steps:
1. Decompose the predicted justification into atomic facts [PRED_FACT]. Each fact should be a separate sentence.
2. Decompose the reference justification into atomic facts [REF_FACT]. Each fact should be a separate sentence.
3. Evaluate each fact in the predicted fact set individually: Check whether it is covered by any fact in the reference set ([REF_FACT]). A predicted fact is covered if it conveys the same meaning or intent as a reference fact, even if the wording differs.
4. Evaluate each fact in the reference fact set individually: Check whether it is covered by any fact in the predicted set ([PRED_FACT]), using the same criteria. Do not use additional sources or background knowledge.
5. Finally summarise (1.) Count how many predicted facts are covered by the reference facts and provide explanations([PRED in REF] and [PRED in REF Exp]), (2.) Count how many reference facts are covered by the predicted facts and provide explanations ([REF in PRED] and [REF in PRED Exp]).
Generate the output as shown in the examples below:

[PRED]: While evidence confirms that Karikó and Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize, none of the sources verify that the photo is from the Nobel ceremony, that the two masked people are indeed Karikó and Weissman, or that they wore masks while accepting the award, so the claim cannot be substantiated with the information available.
[REF]: The claim is successfully refuted by proving that the awards were presented on 4/13/22 a year and a half prior to the awarding of the Nobel Prizes.
[PRED_FACT]: 1. Karikó and Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize. 2. None of the sources verify that the photo is from the Nobel ceremony. 3. None of the sources verify that the two masked people are indeed Karikó and Weissman, or that they wore masks while accepting the award.
[REF_FACT]: 1. The awards were presented on 4/13/22. 2. 4/13/22 is year and a half prior to the awarding of the Nobel Prizes.
[PRED in REF]: 0
[PRED in REF Exp]: 1. The fact is not covered by the predicted fact set. 2. The fact is not covered by the predicted fact set. 3. The fact is not covered by nor similar to any reference fact.
[REF in PRED]: 0
[REF in PRED Exp]: 1. The fact is not covered by the predicted fact set. 2. The fact is not covered by nor similar to any reference fact.

[PRED]: The claim of flowers blooming in Antarctica is refuted because the provided image shows a location in West Greenland, and the typical Antarctic vegetation consists of non-flowering plants like mosses and lichens. The geographic location and type of flora are inconsistent with the claim.
[REF]: The claim is successfully refuted by proving the origin of the photo is in Greenland and that flowers do not grow in Antarctica.
[PRED_FACT]: 1. The provided image shows a location in West Greenland. 2. The typical Antarctic vegetation consists of non-flowering plants like mosses and lichens.
[REF_FACT]: 1. The origin of the photo is in Greenland. 2. The flowers do not grow in  Antarctica.
[PRED in REF]: 2 
[PRED in REF Exp]: 1. The fact is consistent with the first fact in the reference fact set. 2. The fact is covered by the second fact in the reference set.
[REF in PRED]: 2 
[REF in PRED Exp]: 1. The fact is similar to the first fact in the predicted fact set. 2. The fact is covered by the second fact in the predicted fact set.
