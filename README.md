# Baseline Implementation for AVerImaTeC Shared Task

This repository maintains the baseline for [AVerImaTeC shared task](https://huggingface.co/spaces/FEVER-IT/AVerImaTeC). The shared task is built on top of the dataset, AVERIMATEC: A Dataset for Automatic Verification of Image-Text Claims with Evidence from the Web. You can find the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17978).
